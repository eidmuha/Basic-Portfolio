        <p>I am a Full-Stack Developer based in Melbourne. The web development approach, I follow is very dynamic to the cutting-edge 
            technologies and user experiences. I love what I do, and adore the creative and logical process; it is addictive and 
            is my professional job.


            <p>Computer Science and programming is never boring. It is a game-play more and enjoy more. The more we get to know things
                the more we explore and envolved with our work. I have not given up to continue programming and building the websites.
            </p>

            <p>Recent graduate with a master degree in Computer Science from a German university.
            Very good understanding of Computer software and hardware gained from my previous
            jobs and study. And it is time to get cracking with practical stuff.</p>
